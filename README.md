### Instructions to use the app with the glove

Once you have deployed the apk to the PICO headset, you are ready to pair the HEXR glove. Follow the instructions above
to turn on the glove. After that, start the app you just deployed to the headset. Once ready, connect the glove with 
the headset using a USB Type-C to C. As soon you connect the glove, you might be requested to enable permissions for the 
glove to interact with your device. To that, please check allow.

Finally, the current iteration of the app expects that the glove will remain connected. If for some reason, the glove is 
disconnected, **please restart the app and connect the glove again.**



Happy experimenting!
