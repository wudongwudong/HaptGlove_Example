## This project is an example project testing the serial communication of the HEXR glove with the PICO headset.

### Instructions

Once you have deployed the apk to the PICO headset, you are ready to pair the HEXR glove. As soon you attach the glove, 
you might be requested to enable permissions for the glove to interact with your device. To that, please check allow.

Finally, the current iteration of the app expects that the glove will remain connected. If for some reason, the glove is 
disconnected, **please restart the app and connect the glove again.**

Happy experimenting!
